As an automation engineer, I work with the devops/operations supports to 
create my smoke tests.
 For running my tests, I need certain plugins installed on Jenkins, 
   I also need java, maven configured on jenkins, I also need browsers 
installed on the server where the tests will run.
 In my project, only devops/operations support team members have right to 
 do the configurations above. that is why I have to work with them.
 Once the configuration of the Jenkins is completed, 
  I can create and run the smoke test job.
